Simulation SchoolExperiment in the AnyLogic model is set to run on the parameter sweep that is included. To run all the parameter variations
the number of iterations must be increased to 999.

Some parameters are implemented as AnyLogic parameters, while others are hard-coded into the initializeSchool() method.

This model can be ran on the personal learning edition of Anylogic.
