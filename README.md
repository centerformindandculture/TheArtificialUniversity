#The Artificial University

Read ODD for model details.

This version of TAU has separate compliance distributions for students. A high quarantine compliance (QS_Compliance) could be used to represent moving students to a separate location for quarantining.

Some parameters are implemented as AnyLogic parameters, while others are hard-coded into the initializeSchool() method.

This model can be ran on the personal learning edition of Anylogic.

The personal learning edition of Anylogic can be downloaded for free at https://www.anylogic.com/downloads/
